#linkfinder

Link Finder is an Angular.js and Node.js app that queries a SQL Server or MySQL database for backlinks gleaned from Majestic SEO. It allows users who are not familiar with SQL syntax to search for links and export the results of their queries as .csv files for further manipulation and analysis in Excel.
